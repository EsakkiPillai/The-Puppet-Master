Distributed Filesystem :

If a File System is spread across the Network thenit is called Distributed File System..If it follows hadoop rulesthen it Become HDFS Hadoop Distributed File System....

HDFS Default Block Size is 128MB and Minimum Threshold Value is 1MB 

lets say a 150MB file it will be splited into two Blocks 128 + 22 
default  replication Factor is 3 and its configurable . So in HDFS we are actually having 450 MB of data , enenthough the data is replicated / redudanted its a small price we are giving for using hadoop

Lets Consider an Example where we have 150 MB file , it will split in to two BLOCKS 
Every Block has a Block ID , Lets say it as Bo so we are having two Blocks so Bo , B1 ... 


Replica Placement
How does the namenode choose which datanodes to store replicas on? There’s a tradeoff
between reliability and write bandwidth and read bandwidth here. 

Hadoop will place the 
First copy of B0 Block in the same node where client is accessing , 
Second copy of B0 Block will be placed in a random rack and a random node 
Third Copy of B0 Bloack will be placed in the diff data node of same node itself  




WRITE OPERATION :
----------------------------------------------------
Client                   Name node 

datanode   datanode    datanode    datanode

------------------------------------------------------------


1) Clients makes an RPC call  with namenode to write the sample.txt file 
2) Namenode checks whether the file has already exists or not also it checks if the client have permission to write the file , 
		if client doest have write permission it will through the IO exception 
3 ) if client has the permission , Client will split the files in to Blocks and create 2 Queues 
		a) Data Queue -- It will contain all the Blocks of the file   
		b) Ack Queue  -- Once block is written  in hdfs, that Block  is removed from Data Queue and made it to the Ack Queue 
4)  Client ask the namenode where do i write this Block B0 , 
5 ) Namenode will send the List of datanode address where client can write the data { B0 , d1,d3,d5 }
6) Now a pipeline will be created , Client Copies its Data Only to the D1 Datanode .. Once its completed d1 sends the data to the d3 , once its done its send the data to d5 , 
now d5 will send the ack signal to d3 , after that d3 sends the Ack signal to d1 , Now D1 will send the ACK signal to the Client 
Once the Client Receives the ACK from D1 it will remove the Block Id {B0} from the ACK Queue . and it will ask namenode where i can write the B1 Block 

this Process will be continued untill data queue became empty ..... also keep in mind that the block B0 { 128MB} is split in to Packets and send across the network 

7) When the Client finish Writing it calls the complete() method to the Namenode ...





Network topology :

What does it mean for two nodes in a local network to be “close” to each other ?

For example, imagine a node n1 on rack r1 in data center d1. This can be represented
as /d1/r1/n1. Using this notation, here are the distances for the four scenarios:
• distance(/d1/r1/n1, /d1/r1/n1) = 0 (processes on the same node)
• distance(/d1/r1/n1, /d1/r1/n2) = 2 (different nodes on the same rack)
• distance(/d1/r1/n1, /d1/r2/n3) = 4 (nodes on different racks in the same data center)
• distance(/d1/r1/n1, /d2/r3/n4) = 6 (nodes in different data centers)






When Cluster Size reaches 4000 namenode performance start to decrease ... i order to increase the performance we are going for  multiple  name node 

Hadoop 2.0  

	 we have Multi Name node 

HDFS FEDERATION :- 
we dont have federation setup , even in hadoop distribution also ,Its basically a concept 



Inorder  to bring the Name nodeup 

	fsimage  needs to load to memory 
	need to reply all the transaction 
	get report fromallthe data node


FsIMage and Edit Logs are Huge File  ,It need to transfer over the network ,, So it will reduce the performance ofthe cluster if we transfer the files in very less interval to secondary namenode from primary naemnode 
 

HIGH AVALABILITY :- QJM / edit logs 

2) We have two Namenode in a namespace.  So all the data node send its Block Report to both the Name node .  So Active and Passive Have block Mappings always available and same . both Active and Passive Namnode shared the High Available Edit Logs 

Lets Say Active Namenode goes down 

Passsive NAmenode has all the Block Mapping and it wasshared with igh Available edit logs  ,Soat any time we can switch it over to another ....

Its Impossible to Know the system when active namenode is down 

Fail over Process Runs on the NameNode ....  if active nam node doesnt respond for 10sec hadoop makes passive  node as Primary ...  Stand By name node will be active and all the clients comminucate to the Passice name node...  

What if Active namenode was bring up again, ad tries to comminucate te clients then we have 2 namenode iorder toavoidthat hadoop uses fencing concept to killthe namenode

fencing process

	a) it will kill all namenode process
	b) it tries to remove permission for shared edit logss
	c) STONITH -Shoot the Other Node In the Head , it sends a specialsignalwich cuts the power 		   supply fro the machine 





Namespace is the list of all the files managed by that machine


Second Method For High Avalabilty is Journal Node

it not Applicable to Pseudo Distribution Mode

QJM = Quorom Journal Node 

BY default therre are 3 Journal Node canrun in Cluster , they are responsible for active and passive amnode in same space. 

Default 3 Journal nodes will be there, When we do any file operation in hdfs Active namenode continously write it to majority ofthe jpournalnode ...Passive namenode continnously monitor the Journal ode whenever there is any change and if it is present i majority of the journalnode it will writre that change to itself .. by that way it will be same as of active name node if the active namenode goes down ,passivebecame active and failure and fenchigwhich we saw earlier willbe followed ...
