Safe Mode 

    It is a maintanence state of namenode during which namenode doesnt update the filesystem . During this safemode Hadoop Cluster is in read only Mode 
	
	Name Node Enters Safe Mode Automatically When its start up 
	
	At the time of Start Up Namenode will do the Following Activity 
		1) It will load the Fsimage in to the Memory 
		2) Applies the edit log with the old fsimage and will create a new FS Image 
		3) It will receive the block report from the data node 
		
		This is the stage where Name node enters the safe mode automatically .... 
	
	Namenode will wait up to the threshold value of data node block reports which is configurable , 
	
				dfs.namnode.safemode.threshold-pct 0.999f this value should be less than or equal to zero if its greater than 1 safemode is permanent 
				
	once the threshold is reached name node will wait for considerable amount of time for the data block reports before start the replication process , Again this  time 
	is configurable 
	
				dfs.namenode.safemode.extension 3000 ms this is the default value / time for which namenode will wait 
				
	After this time it starts the replication job , i.e. it start to update the under replicated blocks 
	
	Once All the Blocks are replicated Correctly { 3 Times } it leave the safe mode automatically 
	
	
	
	
We can enter the safe mode manually during Maintainenace Activity
