The File System (FS) shell includes various shell-like commands that directly interact with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) 
as well as other file systems that Hadoop supports, such as Local FS, HFTP FS, S3 FS, and others. The FS shell is invoked by:
bin/hadoop fs <args>

appendToFile

Usage: hdfs dfs -appendToFile <localsrc> ... <dst>

Append single src, or multiple srcs from local file system to the destination file system. Also reads input from stdin and appends to destination file system.

hdfs dfs -appendToFile localfile /user/hadoop/hadoopfile
hdfs dfs -appendToFile localfile1 localfile2 /user/hadoop/hadoopfile

chmod
Usage: hdfs dfs -chmod [-R] <MODE[,MODE]... | OCTALMODE> URI [URI ...]

Change the permissions of files. With -R, make the change recursively through the directory structure. The user must be the owner of the file, or else a super-user. Additional information is in the Permissions Guide.
Options

The -R option will make the change recursively through the directory structure.

To create a New directory 
	hdfs dfs -mkdir /esak
	
To List the Files 
	hdfs dfs -ls /
	
To Copy the file from Local to HDFS 
		hdfs dfs -put local source file path  <Hdfs Dest File Path>
		
To Copy the File from HDFS to Local 
	hdfs dfs -get <Hdfs  source file path>   < Local Dest File Path>
	
To View the File 
	hdfs dfs -cat /esak/test.txt
	
To Copy the File From One Location to Another in HDFS 
		hdfs dfs -cp /esak/1 /esakki

To Move the File From One Location to Another in HDFS 
	hdfs dfs -mv /esak/1 /esakki


count

Usage: hdfs dfs -count [-q] [-h] <paths>

Count the number of directories, files and bytes under the paths that match the specified file pattern. The output columns with -count are: DIR_COUNT, FILE_COUNT, CONTENT_SIZE FILE_NAME

The output columns with -count -q are: QUOTA, REMAINING_QUATA, SPACE_QUOTA, REMAINING_SPACE_QUOTA, DIR_COUNT, FILE_COUNT, CONTENT_SIZE, FILE_NAME

The -h option shows sizes in human readable format.

Example:

hdfs dfs -count hdfs://nn1.example.com/file1 hdfs://nn2.example.com/file2
hdfs dfs -count -q hdfs://nn1.example.com/file1
hdfs dfs -count -q -h hdfs://nn1.example.com/file1
Exit Code:

Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

To view the space available in the Cluster 
The -s option will result in an aggregate summary of file lengths being displayed, rather than the individual files.
The -h option will format file sizes in a "human-readable" fashion (e.g 64.0m instead of 67108864)
hdfs dfs -du /user/hadoop/dir1 /user/hadoop/file1 hdfs://nn.example.com/user/hadoop/dir1


getmerge

Usage: hdfs dfs -getmerge <src> <localdst> [addnl]

Takes a source directory and a destination file as input and concatenates files in src into the destination local file. Optionally addnl can be set to enable adding a newline character at the end of each file.


setrep

Usage: hdfs dfs -setrep [-R] [-w] <numReplicas> <path>

Changes the replication factor of a file. If path is a directory then the command recursively changes the replication factor of all files under the directory tree rooted at path.

Options:

The -w flag requests that the command wait for the replication to complete. This can potentially take a very long time.
The -R flag is accepted for backwards compatibility. It has no effect.
Example:

hdfs dfs -setrep -w 3 /user/hadoop/dir1
Exit Code:

Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.

stat

Usage: hdfs dfs -stat URI [URI ...]

Returns the stat information on the path.

Example:

hdfs dfs -stat path
Exit Code: Returns 0 on success and -1 on error.


To Delete the File 
	hdfs dfs -rm  -r /esak/1 /esakki

To View the Last 1 Kb Of the File 

	hdfs dfs -tail  filename

To 
hdfs dfs -stat format file

Check for the Available Free Space in the Folder 
	hdfs dfs -df /

Check for the used  Space in the HDFS 
	hdfs dfs -du /	

To Set the replication Factor for the Particular File 
	hdfs dfs -setrep -5 /esak/1.txt
	
To Delete  the Trash / Recycle Bin 
	hdfs dfs -expunge
	
To change the Mod of the File 
	hdfs dfs -chmod 664 /esak/1.txt

To Create an Empty File in HDFS 
	hdfs dfs -touchz file.txt
