Hive 
----------------------

Hive is a datawarehouse tool built on top of the hadoop 
hive stores its data in the form of files and the data available in HDFS with the replication factor 
Hive sql faced interface => hive uses sql like language called HiveQL and this will be transfered to the mapreduce Program. and it process the data available in theHDFS 
Hive atores its metadat in the Hive Meta Store which is a Traditional RDBMS system 
normally hive Comes with Derby Databse which is a open source Traditional RDBMS file by apache we can configure to any tranditional Database


Differenece Between Hive and RDBMS 

Hive is a datawarehouse system which sits on top of the Hadoop 
Rdbms have different needs and different Architecture 

Hive is not for transactional Processing it is used for Analytical Processing RDBMS is for Transactional process 


Traditional Databases uses indexes to increase performance 

Hive doesnt allow row level updates or deletes  which means data once written and ready many times.This is well suited for analytical purpose since analysts dont update the Historical Data 

Hive is based on Schema On Read

      hive dont guatntee that the data follows the schema , hive tried its best to make sure the schema is followed 
Hive data is stored in HDFS and hive is not the sole gatekeeper for the data these files cab bemodified by other clients , 
Because these underlying files can be changed at any time hive doesnt enforce any schema ( Schema on Write is not an Option}

If HIVe cannot read the schema it will Pad the data as null 


Lets say we have a hive schema

Emp table Fname , Lname , age but the file has only two column esakki, sankar 
when we try to access the age column select age from table it will return Null 

While Write the data it is basically plain Dumps , it doesnt know any schemantics at all during the write operation 

Load /Insert operations  hive will just dump the data without any check 


 
Traditional Rdbms is schema on write these are the sole gatekeeper for the data which under lyes with in it .
No external Program can access the data without going through the database


schema   is the description of the database table { column name , column Type  Constraints } these 3 info are used when we create the table  


CONSTRAINT :Hive doesnt Support Constraints at all 

Delete INSERT :-  update are not Possible in Hive - This is because of schema on read and because of that writes are just dump in Hive 

JOIN :-  hive allow joins it even allow for some customization 

2 major differeence between hive and sql joins 

            a) Hive supports only equiJoins 
            b) Hive doesnt support Natural Joins 
            
  a) SELECT A.FNAME , B.CLASS FROM EMP A JOIN SUB B ON A.EMPID =B.EMPID 
  
  
IN HIVE THE JOIN CONDITION SHOULD BE ONLY EQUAL 
SQL CONDITION SHOULD BE ANYTHING 


NATURAL JOIN :- 

            Natural joins are the joins where the join clause is  implict 

SELECT A.FNAME , B.CLASS FROM EMP A , SUB B in here it will check for the matching column in these two table have same value

Hive doesnt support Natural Join 




SubQueries :-  Hive treats subqueries as mapreduce jobs which causes some restrictions in it 
 UNION Operator is allowed 
 
 INTERSECT MINUS are not exist in HIVE 
 
 
 REstriction in subqueries using IN/EXISTS
