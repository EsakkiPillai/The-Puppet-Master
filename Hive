Hive 
----------------------

Hive is a datawarehouse tool built on top of the hadoop 
hive stores its data in the form of files and the data available in HDFS with the replication factor 
Hive sql faced interface => hive uses sql like language called HiveQL and this will be transfered to the mapreduce Program. and it process the data available in theHDFS 
Hive atores its metadat in the Hive Meta Store which is a Traditional RDBMS system 
normally hive Comes with Derby Databse which is a open source Traditional RDBMS file by apache we can configure to any tranditional Database


Differenece Between Hive and RDBMS 

Hive is a datawarehouse system which sits on top of the Hadoop 
Rdbms have different needs and different Architecture 

Hive is not for transactional Processing it is used for Analytical Processing RDBMS is for Transactional process 


Traditional Databases uses indexes to increase performance 

Hive doesnt allow row level updates or deletes  which means data once written and ready many times.This is well suited for analytical purpose since analysts dont update the Historical Data 

Hive is based on Schema On Read

      hive dont guatntee that the data follows the schema , hive tried its best to make sure the schema is followed 
Hive data is stored in HDFS and hive is not the sole gatekeeper for the data these files cab bemodified by other clients , 
Because these underlying files can be changed at any time hive doesnt enforce any schema ( Schema on Write is not an Option}

If HIVe cannot read the schema it will Pad the data as null 


Lets say we have a hive schema

Emp table Fname , Lname , age but the file has only two column esakki, sankar 
when we try to access the age column select age from table it will return Null 

While Write the data it is basically plain Dumps , it doesnt know any schemantics at all during the write operation 

Load /Insert operations  hive will just dump the data without any check 


 
Traditional Rdbms is schema on write these are the sole gatekeeper for the data which under lyes with in it .
No external Program can access the data without going through the database


schema   is the description of the database table { column name , column Type  Constraints } these 3 info are used when we create the table  


Hive doesnt Support Constraints at all
